## CRITICAL PATH RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Complete Core User Flows (Priority 1)
1. Task 10: Beep (Capture/Upload) screen - CRITICAL USER FLOW
2. Task 07: Profile/Registration UI - USER ONBOARDING
3. Task 21: Upload presign endpoint - MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE
4. Task 27: Push token registration - NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
5. Task 28: Alert fanout (push) - CORE FUNCTIONALITY

### Phase 2: Platform Completeness (Priority 2)
1. Task 17: /app page - APP DISTRIBUTION
2. Task 19: Legal pages (/privacy, /terms, /safety) - COMPLIANCE
3. Task 31: Visibility logic - USER EXPERIENCE
4. Task 34: Error handling + offline caches - RELIABILITY

### Phase 3: Polish & Launch (Priority 3)
1. Task 08Z: Backfill audit - FOUNDATION REVIEW
2. Task 35: Performance pass - OPTIMIZATION

4. Task 39: E2E testing - QUALITY ASSURANCE
5. Task 40: Beta packaging - RELEASE PREPARATION

## CURRENT STATE SUMMARY
- **Completed**: 15/40 tasks (37.5%)
- **Partial**: 11/40 tasks (27.5%)
- **TODO**: 14/40 tasks (35%)

The project has a solid foundation with core infrastructure, basic mobile app functionality, weather enrichment, and chat integration working. The main gaps are in user-facing features (capture flow, profile management) and production readiness (push notifications, error handling, CI/CD).

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Complete Task 10 (Beep screen) - most critical missing user flow
2. Complete Task 07 (Profile/Registration) - user onboarding
3. Implement Task 21 (Upload infrastructure) - media handling
4. Set up Task 27 (Push notifications) - core engagement feature

This analysis reflects the current state as of the comprehensive weather data implementation completed today.
