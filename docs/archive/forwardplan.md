## Key Architecture Decisions:
- **Matrix Protocol**: Use Matrix for decentralized, federated chat with UFOBeep account integration
- **username@ufobeep.com**: Email addresses serve as Matrix IDs and direct messaging
- **Sighting Chat Rooms**: Each sighting auto-creates a Matrix room for community discussion
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel (push, email, Matrix) with user preference controls
- **Human-Readable IDs**: Universal standard (UFO-2025-001234) for all platforms and imports
- **Alert Priority**: Proximity beeps and sounds work FIRST before major feature additions

## Matrix Chat Integration Specifics:
- Matrix rooms named by sighting ID (e.g., #UFO-2025-001234:ufobeep.com)
- Sighting creator gets admin privileges in their sighting's chat room
- "Join Chat" button on every sighting card (web and mobile)
- Optional notifications for sighting creators when others join/comment
- Follow/unfollow system for ongoing chat notifications
- Email alerts for chat activity with unsubscribe options
- Helpful onboarding messages explaining chat features
