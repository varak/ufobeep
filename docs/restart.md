# UFOBeep Restart Session - 2025-08-18

## Current Status
- ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Proximity alerts ARE working properly
- ✅ Import path fix applied and deployed
- ✅ Found 5 devices in 25km radius during test
- ❌ Firebase FCM failing with 404 `/batch` errors

## Key Findings
1. **Proximity alerts service is functional** - successfully finds devices and calculates distances
2. **Alert creation works** - alerts appear on website correctly
3. **Firebase configuration is broken** - getting 404 errors on FCM `/batch` endpoint
4. **Media upload still needs testing**

## Test Results from Production API
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.ufobeep.com/alerts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_id": "test-device-123",
    "location": {"latitude": 40.7589, "longitude": -73.9851},
    "description": "Test beep without media",
    "has_media": false
  }'
```

**Response**: Successfully created alert `500d9655-2c1c-46f8-accb-902ea0c444f5`
**Proximity**: Found 5 devices in 25km radius, delivery time 1168ms
**Firebase**: Failed with 404 errors on `/batch` endpoint

## Debug Logs Confirmed Working
```
Alert creation request: {'device_id': 'test-device-123', ...}
Debug: has_pending_media=False, alert_id=500d9655-2c1c-46f8-accb-902ea0c444f5
Debug: Attempting to send proximity alerts for 500d9655-2c1c-46f8-accb-902ea0c444f5
Debug: Proximity service initialized, calling send_proximity_alerts
Debug: Proximity alerts completed: {'total_alerts_sent': 0, 'devices_1km': 0, 'devices_5km': 0, 'devices_10km': 0, 'devices_25km': 5, 'delivery_time_ms': 1168.7}
```

## Fixed Issues
1. **Import path corrected**: `from services.proximity_alert_service import get_proximity_alert_service`
2. **create_anonymous_beep exists**: Method is properly implemented in AlertsService
3. **Debug logging added**: Can now trace proximity alert execution

## Next Priority Tasks
1. **ACTIVELY WORKING ON: Firebase FCM fix** - Replace credentials or create new Firebase project
   - Current issue: 404 `/batch` errors from Google FCM
   - Need to replace `/home/ufobeep/ufobeep/firebase-service-account.json` with new valid credentials
   - May need to create entirely new Firebase project if "ufobeep" project doesn't exist
2. **Test media upload** - Verify file upload endpoint works
3. **Test actual device notifications** - Once Firebase is fixed

## Firebase Fix Steps
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create/verify "ufobeep" project exists
3. Enable Cloud Messaging API
4. Generate new service account key
5. Replace `/home/ufobeep/ufobeep/firebase-service-account.json`
6. Restart ufobeep-api service

## Current Firebase Project
- Project ID: "ufobeep"
- Type: "service_account"
- Error: 404 on `/batch` endpoint suggests project doesn't exist or FCM not enabled

## Device Status
- 4 test devices connected and updated with latest app
- Apps installed successfully with debug APK
- Ready for notification testing once Firebase is fixed

## Commands to Resume
```bash
# Monitor logs
ssh -p 322 ufobeep@ufobeep.com "sudo journalctl -u ufobeep-api -f"

# Test media upload
curl -X POST https://api.ufobeep.com/alerts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id": "test-456", "location": {"latitude": 40.7589, "longitude": -73.9851}, "description": "Test with media", "has_media": true}'

# Deploy new Firebase credentials
scp -P322 /path/to/firebase-service-account.json ufobeep@ufobeep.com:/home/ufobeep/ufobeep/
ssh -p 322 ufobeep@ufobeep.com "sudo systemctl restart ufobeep-api"
```

## Repository State
- All changes committed and pushed to main
- Production deployed with latest fixes
- Ready to continue debugging Firebase and media upload
