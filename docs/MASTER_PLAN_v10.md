## What's New in v10?

1. **ALERT PREFERENCES** - Phase 1.5 adds comprehensive filtering without breaking emergencies
2. **VISUAL TRACKING** - 🔴🟡🟢⚪ indicators show completion status
3. **ANTI-SPAM PROTECTION** - Prevents the 24-alerts-in-minutes issue
4. **QUIET MODE** - Users can snooze alerts temporarily or set emergency-only mode
5. **QUALITY FILTERING** - Option to only receive alerts with media or multiple witnesses
6. **EMERGENCY OVERRIDE** - Mass sightings bypass all user preferences
7. **BETTER ORGANIZATION** - Alert preferences logically placed in Phase 1.5

### Phase 1.5 Rationale
Alert preferences fit perfectly between initial witness network (Phase 1) and media capture (Phase 2) because:
- Users need witness network features to understand alert quality
- Preferences help manage alert volume before media features add complexity
- Emergency escalation from Phase 1 informs preference design
- User registration (Phase 3) can import and enhance these preferences

This plan maintains the core philosophy: **Getting people to look at something weird in the sky RIGHT NOW** while preventing alert fatigue that could drive users away.

4. Consider Phase 1.5 alert preferences if user fatigue becomes issue
5. Phase 2 media capture (after witness network proven)

Remember: **If it doesn't help people look at something RIGHT NOW, it can wait. But if it prevents people from wanting to look, fix it immediately.**
