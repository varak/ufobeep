## What's New in v10?

1. **ALERT PREFERENCES** - Phase 1.5 adds comprehensive filtering without breaking emergencies
2. **VISUAL TRACKING** - ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢âšª indicators show completion status
3. **ANTI-SPAM PROTECTION** - Prevents the 24-alerts-in-minutes issue
4. **QUIET MODE** - Users can snooze alerts temporarily or set emergency-only mode
5. **QUALITY FILTERING** - Option to only receive alerts with media or multiple witnesses
6. **EMERGENCY OVERRIDE** - Mass sightings bypass all user preferences
7. **BETTER ORGANIZATION** - Alert preferences logically placed in Phase 1.5

### Phase 1.5 Rationale
Alert preferences fit perfectly between initial witness network (Phase 1) and media capture (Phase 2) because:
- Users need witness network features to understand alert quality
- Preferences help manage alert volume before media features add complexity
- Emergency escalation from Phase 1 informs preference design
- User registration (Phase 3) can import and enhance these preferences

This plan maintains the core philosophy: **Getting people to look at something weird in the sky RIGHT NOW** while preventing alert fatigue that could drive users away.

## Current Status Assessment (as of v10 creation)

### Completed Features (ðŸŸ¢)
- Anonymous beeping system working
- Basic proximity alerts with rate limiting
- Admin dashboard (without auto-testing)
- Production deployment pipeline

### In Progress Features (ðŸŸ¡)
- Urgent sound system (partial - basic beep implemented)
- One-tap beep button (UI exists, needs polish)
- Proximity alert system (working but needs distance ring improvements)

### Critical Next Steps
1. Complete Phase 0 foundation (sound system, beep button polish)
2. Implement Phase 1.5 alert preferences to prevent user fatigue
3. Build witness network features (Phase 1)
4. Add media capture without blocking alerts (Phase 2)

Remember: **If it doesn't help people look at something RIGHT NOW, it can wait. But if it prevents people from wanting to look, fix it immediately.**
