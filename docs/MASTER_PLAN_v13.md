# MASTER_PLAN_v13 — UFOBeep

## Debugging Summary - Photo Upload Issues (Aug 21, 2025)

### Root Cause Identified
- **Primary Issue**: Missing `firebase_admin` module on production server
- **Impact**: ALL photo uploads were failing with proximity alerts error
- **Resolution**: Installed firebase_admin using `sudo pip install --break-system-packages firebase-admin`

### Issues Fixed
1. **Proximity Alerts**: Now working (tested - no-media beep from tablet successfully alerted 4 nearby devices)
2. **Phone Photo Uploads**: Working after firebase_admin installation
3. **Tablet No-Media Beeps**: Working correctly

### Final Resolution
- **Tablet Photo Uploads**: ✅ **FIXED** - Camera app needed location permissions
- **Root Cause**: Camera app (not UFOBeep app) lacked location permission to embed GPS data in photo EXIF
- **Solution**: Granted location permissions to tablet's camera application

### System Status - ALL WORKING ✅
- API: ✅ Running (ufobeep-api.service active)
- Proximity Alerts: ✅ Working (firebase_admin installed)
- Push Notifications: ✅ Working (some old tokens failing as expected)
- Phone Uploads: ✅ Working
- Tablet Uploads: ✅ Working (camera permissions fixed)
